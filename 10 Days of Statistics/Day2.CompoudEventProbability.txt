Task:
There are 3 urns labeled X, Y, and Z. 

Urn X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.
Urn Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
Urn Z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls. 

One ball is drawn from each of the 3 urns. What is the probability that, of the 3 balls drawn, 2 are red and 1 is black?


Solution:
P(2 Red, 1 Black) can be divided into 3 independent senarios
= P(X=Red Y=Red Z=Black) + P(X=Red Y=Black Z=Red) + P(X=Black Y=Red Z=Red)
= (4/7)(5/9)(1/2) + (4/7)(4/9)(1/2) + (3/7)(5/9)(1/2)
= (20+16+15)/7*9*2ï¼‰ 
= 51/126 
= 17/42
